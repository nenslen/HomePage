# New Tab Page
A page I use when a new tab is opened in chrome. This way I have easy access to many sites with a single click, as well as the weather. It's true there are extensions for chrome that already do this, but I wanted to create a unique experience for my own use.

Use numbers 0 - 9 for quick access to the first 10 links.
